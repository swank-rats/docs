# Introduction

## Game Idea

Swank Rat is a rat fighter game. Two rats are trying to shoot each other with cheese. 
The rats are represented by robots which are controlled by two players. With a Camera
over the Game-World can the software "see" where the rats are. In addition, the obstacles
are detected over this camera. This obstacles are straight walls (e.g. wood slates with
a red with a red mark). The Rats are able to throw pieces of cheese after the opponent.
The walls serve as a limitation for the cheese-bullets.

To control the robots the live video of the world (overlaid with video of the cheese-bullets)
will be displayed in a HTML UI in the browser. With buttons (and keyboard shortcuts) can
the player control the real robot.
 
If a robot is hit (one or more) the game is over.
