# Game controlls

A robot can be controlled with the arrow keys:
- up will accelerate the robot and it will drive in the direction it is looking
- down will accelerate the robot and it will drive backwards
- left will rotate the robot to the left
- right will rotate the robot to the right

With the spacebar the player can shoot. As long as the keys are pressed the robot will drive (the client send the server continuously commands). When no key is pressed the robot will stop.
