#The game logic

##Starting a game
To start a game a defined number of players (in our case two) is needed. This means the first player which gets to the games page will have to choose a color and start a new game. The second one can join the game after choosing a color. This means when no game is ready one has to be created. When a game in the ready status exists, players can join the game as long as the maximum number is reached. When the maximum is reached no player can join the game anymore. For the players which joined it the game will now start.
